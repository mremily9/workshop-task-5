# Progress (Problem Solving/Code)
**Creating the idea**

I first started out with looking into what type of data about myself that I can collect/is easy to get. 
I had found some heavy inspiration on the yearly wrapped trend and wanted to create something like that or use data that was similar in nature to music and listening habits.

I then landed on using data grabbed from steamDB on my steam profile to see what games I play, how many hours etc

I opened up a google sheet and created my table within it

**Coding the Bar Graph**

I started by sketching out my idea to help me visualise what I wanted.

I followed with the workshop video on making a bar graph however I was then put into problem #1. 

**Problem #1: Bar graph not loading**

At this point, I was a bit stumped; having followed the workshop video, I wondered why my bar graph didn't show up.
